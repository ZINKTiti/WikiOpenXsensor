> Latest versions of openXsensor : [OpenXsensor v8.0.1](https://github.com/openXsensor/openXsensor/archive/v8.0.1.zip)

Note : oldier vesions are still available as releases (click on "releases" buttom on the home screen of the github site)

For releases 2 and 3, it is possible to edit the oXs_config.h file with a desktop application named oXs Configurator (available in oXs_Configurator repository). Still this application is currently not compatible with more recent releases.
So in order to set up your openXsensor, you now have to edit manually the file oXs_config.h
